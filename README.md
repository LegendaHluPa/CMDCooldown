Do players use the commands given to them too often?
So take that away from them and make cooldown on the command
This plugin allows you to make a cooldown for Any command you have on the server, and for convenient interaction we have a Gui to quickly remove a command from the cooldown or change its time.

This is my first plugin, I will update it when possible

Plugin Command:
/cc - open interactive menu
